BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theBOD 22-01 Fact Sheetfor more information.\n\nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation ofKEV Catalog vulnerabilitiesas part of their vulnerability management practice.
